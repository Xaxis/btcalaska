## Slide 2: Format Change
**Title:** From Structured Sessions to Open Dialogue

**Content:**
### Why We Changed Our Approach
Originally, we planned three separate 90-minute technical workshops. But we realized something important: the best Bitcoin education happens through conversation, not lecture. The most valuable insights come from the questions you ask, the problems you're trying to solve, and the real-world scenarios you face living in Alaska.

### What This Means for You
- **Interactive Q&A Format:** Raise your hand, ask questions, challenge ideas. This is your session.
- **Hands-On Demonstrations:** We have hardware here - Coldcards, Raspberry Pis, mining equipment. Want to see how something works? We'll show you.
- **No Prerequisites:** Whether you've never heard of Bitcoin or you're running your own Lightning node, there's something here for you.
- **Community Learning:** The person next to you might have the exact answer you need. We're all teachers and students here.

### The Philosophy Behind This Change
Bitcoin itself is about removing intermediaries and empowering individuals. Our education should reflect that same philosophy. Instead of us talking at you, we're creating a space where knowledge flows freely in all directions.

## Slide 3: Session Overview
**Title:** Today's Session Overview

**Content:**
### Philosophy Track: Why Bitcoin Matters
**The Nature of Money:** What makes something "money"? Why did societies move from barter to gold to paper to digital? Understanding this history is crucial to understanding why Bitcoin is inevitable.

**Sound Money Principles:** For most of human history, money was scarce and hard to produce. The last 50 years of unlimited money printing is an aberration. Bitcoin returns us to sound money principles.

**Individual Sovereignty:** Bitcoin isn't just about making money - it's about taking back control of your financial life. No banks, no governments, no intermediaries between you and your wealth.

### Technical Track: How Bitcoin Works
**Cold Storage & Security:** How to store Bitcoin safely for decades. We'll demonstrate hardware wallets, multisig setups, and backup strategies designed for Alaska's unique challenges.

**Running Your Own Node:** Why "don't trust, verify" matters and how to achieve true financial sovereignty by running your own Bitcoin node.

**Mining in Alaska:** How Alaska's abundant renewable energy makes it one of the best places in the world to mine Bitcoin profitably and sustainably.

### The Alaska Advantage
Throughout both tracks, we'll explore why Alaska is uniquely positioned to benefit from Bitcoin adoption - from our energy abundance to our culture of self-reliance.

## Slide 4: What is Money?
**Title:** What is Money?
**Subtitle:** Understanding the Foundation of Economic Exchange

**Content:**
### The Evolution of Money Through History

**Barter Systems (Pre-3000 BCE):** Direct exchange of goods and services. A farmer trades wheat for a blacksmith's tools. The fundamental problem: the "double coincidence of wants" - both parties must want what the other offers at the exact same time.

**Commodity Money (3000 BCE - 1900s):** Societies discovered that certain commodities work better as money. Gold and silver emerged as winners because they're durable, portable, divisible, and universally valued. A gold coin represents actual stored value.

**Representative Money (1800s-1971):** Paper money backed by gold reserves. The U.S. dollar was redeemable for gold at $35/ounce. This system collapsed when governments printed more money than they had gold to back it.

**Fiat Currency (1971-Present):** Money by government decree with no backing. The dollar became "legal tender" simply because the government says so. Value depends entirely on trust in the issuing authority.

### Key Insight
Bitcoin is the first technology in human history that perfectly satisfies all six properties of sound money while being completely digital and decentralized.

## Slide 5: Fiat Problems
**Title:** The Fundamental Problems with Fiat Currency
**Subtitle:** Why Our Current Monetary System is Broken

**Content:**
### Inflation: The Hidden Tax on Your Savings
Since 1971, when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard, the dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power. What cost $1 in 1971 costs $6.50 today. This isn't natural price discovery - it's systematic wealth confiscation.

**The Mechanism:** Central banks create new money digitally, increasing the money supply. More dollars chasing the same goods = higher prices. Your savings lose value even sitting in the bank.

### Central Control: Unelected Officials Control Your Money
The Federal Reserve, a private institution, makes monetary policy affecting 330 million Americans. These officials decide interest rates, money supply, and which banks get bailouts - yet they're not elected by the people.

**The Cantillon Effect:** Those closest to money creation (banks, government, wealthy) benefit first. By the time new money reaches regular people, prices have already risen. This systematically transfers wealth from the poor to the rich.

*"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation." - Alan Greenspan, Former Fed Chairman*

## Slide 6: Bitcoin's Foundation
**Title:** Bitcoin's Philosophical Foundation
**Subtitle:** The Revolutionary Ideas Behind Digital Sound Money

**Content:**
### Satoshi's Vision: Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
On October 31, 2008, an anonymous person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto published a 9-page paper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." This wasn't just a technical specification - it was a manifesto for financial freedom.

**The Core Problem Satoshi Solved:** How do you create digital money without a trusted third party? Before Bitcoin, all digital payments required banks, credit card companies, or payment processors that could freeze accounts, reverse transactions, charge fees, and monitor all activity.

### The Genesis Block Message
On January 3, 2009, Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block and embedded a message:

*"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"*

This wasn't random. While governments were bailing out the banks that caused the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi was building an alternative system where bailouts are impossible.

### Core Principles
**Decentralization, Immutability, Transparency, Permissionless operation, and Trustless verification** through cryptographic proof rather than institutional trust.

## Slide 7: Sound Money
**Title:** Sound Money Principles
**Subtitle:** How Bitcoin Perfects the Properties of Money

**Content:**
### Bitcoin as the Ultimate Sound Money
For thousands of years, gold was the best money humanity had. Bitcoin takes the best properties of gold and perfects them for the digital age while adding new capabilities that were never possible before.

### Fixed Supply: The 21 Million Limit
**The Hard Cap:** There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. This isn't a policy decision that can be changed - it's written into the code and enforced by every participant in the network.

**The Issuance Schedule:** New Bitcoin are created through mining, but the rate decreases over time through "halvings" every four years. This continues until around 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined.

### Perfect Divisibility
Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis. If Bitcoin reaches $1 million per coin, one satoshi would be worth $0.01 (one cent). This ensures Bitcoin can function as money regardless of its price.

### Why Bitcoin is Superior to Gold
**Verification** (instant with software), **Divisibility** (perfect digital division), **Portability** (travels at light speed), **Storage** (can be memorized), and **Absolute Scarcity** (mathematically fixed supply).

## Slide 8: Individual Sovereignty
**Title:** Individual Sovereignty
**Subtitle:** Be Your Own Bank: Taking Control of Your Financial Life

**Content:**
### What Does "Be Your Own Bank" Actually Mean?
- **Custody:** You hold your own money instead of trusting a bank
- **Verification:** You verify your own transactions instead of trusting bank records
- **Authorization:** You authorize payments without needing bank approval
- **Privacy:** You control who sees your financial information
- **Availability:** Your money is available 24/7, not just banking hours

### Self-Custody: Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin
In Bitcoin, whoever controls the private keys controls the Bitcoin. If someone else holds your keys (like an exchange), they control your Bitcoin, not you.

**Real-World Example:** In 2022, the FTX exchange collapsed, and millions of people lost their Bitcoin because they didn't control their own keys. People who held their own keys were unaffected.

### Why This Matters for Alaskans
Self-reliance culture, remote living challenges, economic independence, and privacy values all align perfectly with Bitcoin's self-custody principles.

## Slide 9: Austrian Economics
**Title:** The Austrian School Connection
**Subtitle:** How Bitcoin Validates 150 Years of Economic Theory

**Content:**
### Ludwig von Mises and Sound Money Theory
In 1912, Mises explained that money emerges naturally from the most marketable commodity. He predicted that abandoning the gold standard would lead to economic instability, inflation, and government overreach. He was proven right throughout the 20th century.

### Time Preference: The Foundation of Interest and Savings
**High Time Preference:** Preferring immediate gratification, spending money as soon as you get it.
**Low Time Preference:** Willing to delay gratification for future benefit, saving and building for the long term.

**How Sound Money Affects Time Preference:** Sound money (Gold/Bitcoin) encourages saving because money holds value over time. Fiat money encourages spending because money loses value over time.

### The Cantillon Effect
New money doesn't appear everywhere simultaneously. It enters at specific points (banks, government, corporations). First recipients spend at current prices while later recipients face higher prices with same income. Bitcoin has no central issuer, eliminating this effect.

### Bitcoin Connection
Bitcoin enables low time preference thinking and validates Austrian economic theory in practice, not just theory.

## Slide 10: Alaska Perspective
**Title:** The Alaskan Perspective
**Subtitle:** Why Alaska is Uniquely Positioned for Bitcoin Adoption

**Content:**
### Alaskan Values Align with Bitcoin Principles
- **Self-Reliance:** Alaskans don't wait for others to solve problems - same mindset applies to money
- **Independence:** Alaska fought for statehood to control its destiny - Bitcoin offers monetary independence
- **Resourcefulness:** Living in Alaska requires creative problem-solving - Bitcoin rewards this mindset
- **Community Cooperation:** Strong communities without central authority - like Bitcoin's network

### Alaska's Energy Abundance: A Bitcoin Mining Paradise
**Renewable Resources:** Hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and natural gas - much of it "stranded" with no way to transport to markets.

**Bitcoin's Solution:** Bitcoin mining can monetize stranded energy anywhere there's internet, turning wasted energy into digital gold.

### Climate Advantages
- Cold weather provides free cooling for mining equipment
- Mining heat can warm homes and buildings
- Extended winter heating season makes heat recovery valuable

### The Perfect Storm
Alaska has abundant renewable energy, culture of self-reliance, need for financial inclusion in remote areas, opportunity for economic diversification, and climate advantages for mining.
