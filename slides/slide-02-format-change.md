# From Structured Sessions to Open Dialogue

## Why We Changed Our Approach

Originally, we planned three separate 90-minute technical workshops. But we realized something important: the best Bitcoin education happens through conversation, not lecture. The most valuable insights come from the questions you ask, the problems you're trying to solve, and the real-world scenarios you face living in Alaska.

### What This Means for You

**Interactive Q&A Format:** Raise your hand, ask questions, challenge ideas. This is your session.

**Hands-On Demonstrations:** We have hardware here - Coldcards, Raspberry Pis, mining equipment. Want to see how something works? We'll show you.

**No Prerequisites:** Whether you've never heard of Bitcoin or you're running your own Lightning node, there's something here for you.

**Community Learning:** The person next to you might have the exact answer you need. We're all teachers and students here.

### The Philosophy Behind This Change

Bitcoin itself is about removing intermediaries and empowering individuals. Our education should reflect that same philosophy. Instead of us talking at you, we're creating a space where knowledge flows freely in all directions.

**Your curiosity shapes our conversation.**
