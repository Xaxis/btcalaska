# The Fundamental Problems with Fiat Currency
## Why Our Current Monetary System is Broken

### Inflation: The Hidden Tax on Your Savings

Since 1971, when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard, the dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power. What cost $1 in 1971 costs $6.50 today. This isn't natural price discovery - it's systematic wealth confiscation.

**The Mechanism:** Central banks create new money digitally with a few keystrokes, increasing the money supply. More dollars chasing the same goods = higher prices. Your savings lose value even sitting in the bank earning "interest."

**Real Example:** A house that cost $25,000 in 1971 now costs $400,000. Did the house become 16x more valuable, or did the dollar become 16x less valuable? The house is the same wood, brick, and land. The dollar is what changed.

**The Savings Trap:** Traditional advice says "save money in the bank." But if inflation runs 7% and your savings account pays 0.5%, you're losing 6.5% of your wealth every year. You're being punished for saving.

### Central Control: Unelected Officials Control Your Money

The Federal Reserve, a private institution, makes monetary policy affecting 330 million Americans. These officials are not elected by the people, yet they decide:
- Interest rates that affect your mortgage, credit cards, and savings
- Money supply that determines inflation rates
- Which banks get bailouts during financial crises
- When to create trillions of new dollars

**The Democratic Deficit:** You vote for politicians, but you don't vote for the people who control your money. The Fed operates with minimal oversight and maximum secrecy.

### The Cantillon Effect: How Money Printing Creates Inequality

When new money is created, it doesn't appear everywhere simultaneously. It enters the economy at specific points - usually banks, government, and large corporations. These first recipients can spend the new money before prices rise.

**The Process:**
1. Fed creates $1 trillion digitally
2. Banks and government spend this money first (at current prices)
3. Money flows through the economy, raising prices
4. By the time it reaches regular people, everything costs more

This systematically transfers wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthy and well-connected. It's not a bug - it's a feature of the fiat system.

### Unlimited Supply: The Printing Press Problem

Unlike gold, which requires mining and has physical limits, fiat money can be created infinitely at zero cost. During COVID-19, the U.S. printed 40% of all dollars ever created in just two years. The M2 money supply went from $15 trillion to $22 trillion.

**Historical Failures:** Every fiat currency in history has eventually failed through hyperinflation:
- German Weimar Republic (1923): A wheelbarrow of cash couldn't buy bread
- Zimbabwe Dollar (2008): 231 million percent inflation; people used money as toilet paper
- Venezuelan Bol√≠var (ongoing): Doctors and engineers flee the country to work in other nations
- Turkish Lira (2021): Lost 80% of its value in one year

### The Greenspan Admission

Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve Chairman and architect of modern monetary policy, admitted the fundamental flaw:

*"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value."*

Even the people who designed the current system know it's broken. They just benefit from being at the top of the Cantillon pyramid.

### Why This Matters for Alaskans

Alaska's economy depends on natural resources with volatile prices. When the dollar weakens, commodity prices often rise, which can benefit Alaska short-term. But long-term, inflation hurts everyone:
- Fixed incomes (retirees, government workers) lose purchasing power
- Young people can't afford homes
- Small businesses struggle with unpredictable costs
- Savings become worthless over time

Bitcoin offers an escape from this system - a return to sound money that can't be debased by politicians or central bankers.
