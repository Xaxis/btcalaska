3. **Entropy Calculation:**
   - Each die provides log‚ÇÇ(6) = 2.58 bits of entropy
   - Need 256 bits total for seed security
   - Minimum 99 rolls required (99 √ó 2.58 = 255.4 bits)
   - Use 128 rolls for extra security margin

4. **Base Conversion:**
   - Convert dice results to binary
   - Group binary digits into 11-bit chunks
   - Map to BIP39 word list indices
   - Verify checksum calculation

**Example Conversion Process:**
```
Dice rolls: 1,4,2,6,3,5... (128 total)
Binary: 001,100,010,110,011,101...
11-bit groups: 00110001011, 01101110100...
Word indices: 395, 884...
BIP39 words: "dawn", "refuse"...
```
