# Cold Storage & Security
## Protecting Your Bitcoin in Alaska's Extreme Environment

### Understanding the Threat Model

Before we talk about solutions, let's understand what we're protecting against. Security isn't one-size-fits-all - it depends on your specific situation, the amount of Bitcoin you're securing, and the unique risks you face living in Alaska.

**Common Threats Everywhere:**
- Hackers trying to steal your private keys
- Phishing attacks and malicious software
- Exchange hacks and third-party failures
- Loss of access due to forgotten passwords
- Physical theft of devices

**Alaska-Specific Threats:**
- Extreme weather damaging hardware
- Remote locations making recovery difficult
- Limited internet connectivity for updates
- Isolation making you a target if wealth is known
- Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires)

### Hardware Wallets: Your First Line of Defense

**What is a Hardware Wallet?** A specialized computer designed to generate and store private keys securely. The keys never leave the device, even when signing transactions.

**Coldcard Mk4 - The Gold Standard:**
- **Air-Gap Capable:** Can operate completely offline using SD cards or QR codes
- **Secure Element:** Military-grade chip protects against physical attacks
- **Open Source:** Code is auditable by security experts
- **Duress Features:** Hidden wallets and brick-on-tamper protection
- **Alaska Advantage:** Operates in extreme temperatures (-20°C to +60°C)

**SeedSigner - DIY Security:**
- **Completely Air-Gapped:** Never connects to internet or computers
- **Camera-Based:** Uses QR codes for all communication
- **Reproducible:** Build from off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi components
- **Stateless:** Doesn't store anything - recreated from seed each time
- **Alaska Advantage:** Can be rebuilt if damaged, parts available locally

**Passport - User-Friendly Security:**
- **Beautiful Design:** Easiest hardware wallet to use
- **Air-Gap Option:** Can operate via QR codes or USB
- **Open Source:** Fully auditable firmware and hardware
- **Secure Element:** Protected against physical attacks
- **Alaska Advantage:** Intuitive interface reduces user error

### Generating True Entropy: The Foundation of Security

**Why Entropy Matters:** Your Bitcoin's security depends entirely on the randomness of your private keys. If someone can guess or reproduce your randomness, they can steal your Bitcoin.

**The Problem with Computer Randomness:** Computers are deterministic machines - they can't generate true randomness. They use "pseudo-random" number generators that can be predicted if you know the algorithm and seed.

**Dice Method - Maximum Security:**
1. Use casino-grade dice (perfectly balanced)
2. Roll dice 99 times for a 12-word seed
3. Convert dice rolls to BIP39 words using lookup tables
4. This method is provably random and auditable

**Camera Entropy - SeedSigner Method:**
1. Take photos of random scenes (clouds, fire, water)
2. SeedSigner extracts entropy from pixel variations
3. Combines multiple sources for maximum randomness
4. You can verify the process is working correctly

**Coin Flipping - Simple but Effective:**
1. Flip a coin 128 times for a 12-word seed
2. Record heads as 1, tails as 0
3. Convert binary to BIP39 words
4. Requires only a coin and paper

### Multisig: Eliminating Single Points of Failure

**What is Multisig?** A Bitcoin wallet that requires multiple signatures to spend funds. For example, a 2-of-3 multisig requires 2 signatures from 3 possible keys.

**Why Multisig Matters:**
- **No Single Point of Failure:** Losing one key doesn't mean losing your Bitcoin
- **Inheritance Planning:** Family members can access funds if something happens to you
- **Geographic Distribution:** Keys stored in different locations survive local disasters
- **Reduced Kidnapping Risk:** You can't be forced to give up funds with just one key

**2-of-3 Multisig Setup:**
- **Key 1:** Coldcard at home
- **Key 2:** SeedSigner backup at cabin/cache
- **Key 3:** Passport with trusted family member in Lower 48

**3-of-5 Multisig for Large Holdings:**
- **Key 1:** Personal Coldcard
- **Key 2:** Backup Coldcard in safe deposit box
- **Key 3:** SeedSigner at remote location
- **Key 4:** Family member in different state
- **Key 5:** Professional custody service

**Alaska Considerations:**
- Geographic isolation makes key distribution challenging
- Weather can prevent access to backup locations
- Limited banking infrastructure for safe deposit boxes
- Strong community ties can help with trusted key holders

### Air-Gap Signing: Maximum Security

**What is Air-Gap Signing?** Signing Bitcoin transactions on a device that has never been connected to the internet. This eliminates the possibility of remote attacks.

**PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions):**
1. Create unsigned transaction on internet-connected computer
2. Transfer to air-gapped device via SD card or QR code
3. Sign transaction on air-gapped device
4. Transfer signed transaction back to internet-connected device
5. Broadcast to Bitcoin network

**QR Code Method:**
- Most secure - no physical connection between devices
- Works with SeedSigner and modern hardware wallets
- Can be done completely offline
- Immune to USB-based attacks

**SD Card Method:**
- Faster for large transactions
- Works well with Coldcard
- Requires careful SD card handling
- Risk of malware on SD card

### Backup Strategies for Alaska

**The 3-2-1 Rule:**
- **3** copies of important data
- **2** different types of media
- **1** copy stored off-site

**Steel Plate Backups:**
- **Fireproof:** Survives house fires up to 2000°F
- **Waterproof:** Unaffected by floods or moisture
- **Corrosion Resistant:** Stainless steel lasts centuries
- **Shock Resistant:** Survives earthquakes and impacts

**Geographic Distribution:**
- **Primary:** Steel backup at home in fireproof safe
- **Secondary:** Steel backup at cabin or cache site
- **Tertiary:** Paper backup with trusted family member
- **Quaternary:** Encrypted digital backup in cloud storage

**Alaska-Specific Considerations:**
- **Permafrost:** Ground doesn't thaw, making buried caches stable
- **Remote Cabins:** Natural off-site storage locations
- **Seasonal Access:** Some locations only accessible certain times of year
- **Wildlife:** Bears and other animals can damage outdoor caches

### Recovery Testing: Practice Makes Perfect

**Why Test Recovery?** The only way to know your backup works is to test it. Many people discover their backups are incomplete or corrupted only when they need them.

**Testing Schedule:**
- **Monthly:** Verify you can access all backup locations
- **Quarterly:** Test recovery from one backup method
- **Annually:** Full recovery test from each backup location

**Recovery Scenarios to Test:**
- Primary device destroyed in fire
- Forgotten passphrase
- Corrupted seed phrase backup
- Multisig key holder unavailable
- Complete loss of primary residence

### Operational Security (OpSec)

**Physical Security:**
- Don't discuss Bitcoin holdings publicly
- Vary your routines and travel patterns
- Use decoy wallets with small amounts
- Consider the $5 wrench attack - sometimes compliance is safer than resistance

**Digital Security:**
- Use dedicated computers for Bitcoin activities
- Keep software updated but verify signatures
- Use Tor for enhanced privacy
- Avoid public WiFi for sensitive operations

**Social Engineering Protection:**
- Never share seed phrases or private keys
- Be suspicious of "urgent" requests for access
- Verify identities through multiple channels
- Educate family members about common scams

### Alaska Advantages for Security

**Natural Isolation:** Remote locations provide physical security through obscurity.

**Harsh Environment:** Extreme weather deters casual criminals and provides natural protection for caches.

**Community Trust:** Strong community bonds enable trusted key sharing arrangements.

**Self-Reliance Culture:** Alaskans are naturally prepared for emergencies and understand the importance of redundancy.

**Energy Independence:** Many Alaskans have backup power systems, ensuring access to Bitcoin even during outages.
