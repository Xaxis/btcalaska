# Bitcoin Alaska: Open Forum & Education Sessions

## Community-Driven Learning
**Your Questions Drive Our Discussion**

Welcome to a new format for Bitcoin education in Alaska. Instead of rigid presentations, we're creating an interactive space where your curiosity shapes our conversation. Whether you're completely new to Bitcoin or a seasoned hodler, this forum is designed to meet you where you are and take you where you want to go.

### What Makes This Different
- **No Stupid Questions:** Every question, no matter how basic, helps someone else learn
- **Real Hardware:** We have actual devices to demonstrate concepts hands-on
- **Alaska Focus:** Tailored specifically for our unique environment and opportunities
- **Community Building:** Building lasting connections in the Alaska Bitcoin community
