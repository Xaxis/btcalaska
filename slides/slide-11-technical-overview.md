# Technical Topics: From Theory to Practice
## Hands-On Bitcoin Skills for Alaskans

Now that we've covered the philosophical foundation, let's dive into the practical skills you need to use Bitcoin safely and effectively. These aren't just theoretical concepts - we have the actual hardware here to demonstrate everything we discuss.

### Cold Storage & Security: Protecting Your Bitcoin for Decades

**Why Cold Storage Matters:** If you're going to hold Bitcoin long-term (and you should), you need to store it securely. "Hot" wallets connected to the internet are convenient but vulnerable. "Cold" storage keeps your private keys offline and safe from hackers.

**What We'll Demonstrate:**
- **Hardware Wallet Setup:** Complete walkthrough of Coldcard, SeedSigner, and Passport devices
- **Seed Phrase Generation:** Using dice, camera entropy, and other methods to create truly random seeds
- **Multisig Configuration:** Setting up 2-of-3 and 3-of-5 multisig wallets for enhanced security
- **Air-Gap Signing:** How to sign transactions without ever connecting to the internet
- **Backup Strategies:** Steel plate backups, geographic distribution, and recovery testing

**Alaska-Specific Considerations:**
- Protecting hardware from extreme temperatures
- Backup strategies for remote locations
- Threat modeling for unique Alaska risks

### Node Operation: Achieving True Financial Sovereignty

**Why Run Your Own Node:** When you use someone else's Bitcoin node, you're trusting them to tell you the truth about the blockchain. Running your own node means you verify everything yourself - the ultimate expression of "don't trust, verify."

**What We'll Show:**
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Assembly:** Building a complete Bitcoin node from components
- **Software Installation:** Installing and configuring Bitcoin Core, Electrum Server, and Lightning
- **Initial Block Download:** Syncing the entire Bitcoin blockchain (and why it matters)
- **Lightning Network Setup:** Opening channels and making instant payments
- **Remote Management:** Accessing your node securely from anywhere

**Benefits for Alaskans:**
- Financial services that work anywhere with internet
- No dependence on third-party services
- Enhanced privacy and security
- Supporting the Bitcoin network's decentralization

### Home Mining: Turning Alaska's Energy into Digital Gold

**The Mining Opportunity:** Alaska has some of the cheapest renewable energy in the world, making it ideal for Bitcoin mining. We'll show you how to get started with home mining using the latest efficient hardware.

**What We'll Demonstrate:**
- **Bitaxe Ultra Assembly:** Building an open-source ASIC miner from components
- **Pool Configuration:** Connecting to mining pools and understanding Stratum v2
- **Performance Optimization:** Tuning for maximum efficiency and profitability
- **Heat Recovery Systems:** Using mining heat to warm your home
- **Economics Analysis:** Calculating profitability with Alaska energy costs

**Alaska Advantages:**
- Abundant renewable energy
- Cold climate provides free cooling
- Heat recovery extends mining season profitability
- Opportunity to monetize stranded energy

### Lightning Network: Bitcoin's Payment Layer

**Why Lightning Matters:** Bitcoin's base layer is optimized for security and decentralization, not speed. The Lightning Network is a second layer that enables instant, low-cost payments while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees.

**Live Demonstrations:**
- **Channel Opening:** How Lightning channels work and how to open them
- **Instant Payments:** Sending payments that settle in milliseconds
- **Routing:** How payments find their way across the network
- **LNURL and Modern UX:** User-friendly Lightning applications
- **Liquidity Management:** Keeping channels balanced and functional

**Use Cases for Alaska:**
- Instant payments for tourism and hospitality
- Micropayments for content and services
- Cross-border remittances without banking delays
- Machine-to-machine payments for IoT applications

### Privacy and Security: Protecting Your Financial Sovereignty

**Why Privacy Matters:** Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, not anonymous. With proper analysis, transactions can be traced back to individuals. Privacy techniques help protect your financial information from surveillance and targeting.

**Techniques We'll Cover:**
- **CoinJoin:** Breaking the link between your transactions
- **Address Management:** Never reusing Bitcoin addresses
- **UTXO Management:** Controlling which coins you spend
- **Tor Integration:** Hiding your network activity
- **Lightning Privacy:** Using Lightning for private payments

**Alaska Considerations:**
- Protecting privacy in small communities where everyone knows everyone
- Avoiding targeting by criminals who might know your Bitcoin holdings
- Maintaining privacy from overreaching government surveillance

### Advanced Topics: The Cutting Edge

For those ready to dive deeper, we'll discuss:

**Taproot and Schnorr Signatures:** Bitcoin's latest upgrade that improves privacy and enables more complex smart contracts.

**RGB and Smart Contracts:** How to build sophisticated applications on Bitcoin without compromising its security model.

**Sidechains and Federated Networks:** Liquid Network and other systems that extend Bitcoin's capabilities.

**Self-Sovereign Identity:** Using Bitcoin's infrastructure for identity and authentication systems.
