# Running Your Own Bitcoin Node
## Achieving True Financial Sovereignty Through Self-Verification

### Why "Don't Trust, Verify" Matters

When you use someone else's Bitcoin node (like a mobile wallet or web service), you're trusting them to tell you the truth about:
- Your Bitcoin balance
- Transaction confirmations
- Network rules and consensus
- Fee estimates and mempool status

Running your own node means you verify everything yourself. You become a first-class citizen of the Bitcoin network instead of a dependent user.

### What is a Bitcoin Node?

**Full Node Definition:** A computer that downloads, validates, and stores the complete Bitcoin blockchain. It enforces all Bitcoin rules and can independently verify any transaction or block.

**Key Functions:**
- **Validation:** Checks every transaction and block against Bitcoin rules
- **Storage:** Maintains complete copy of the blockchain (currently ~500GB)
- **Networking:** Connects to other nodes to share transactions and blocks
- **Serving:** Provides data to wallets and other applications

**Not Just Storage:** A node isn't just a database - it's an active participant in the Bitcoin network that helps maintain consensus and security.

### The Raspberry Pi 5: Perfect for Alaska

**Why Raspberry Pi?**
- **Low Power:** Uses only 5-15 watts (less than a light bulb)
- **Reliable:** Designed for 24/7 operation
- **Affordable:** Complete setup under $300
- **Compact:** Fits in your hand
- **Silent:** No fans needed with proper cooling

**Alaska Advantages:**
- **Cold Climate:** Natural cooling extends hardware life
- **Backup Power:** Easy to run on battery/solar during outages
- **Remote Operation:** SSH access from anywhere with internet
- **Low Bandwidth:** Works with satellite internet connections

### Hardware Assembly Walkthrough

**Components Needed:**
- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM recommended)
- High-quality microSD card (64GB minimum)
- External SSD (1TB minimum for full node)
- Power supply (official Pi 5 adapter)
- Case with cooling (passive heatsink or active fan)
- Ethernet cable (WiFi works but wired is better)

**Assembly Process:**
1. Install heatsink or cooling solution
2. Insert microSD card with operating system
3. Connect SSD via USB 3.0
4. Connect ethernet and power
5. Initial boot and configuration

**Alaska Considerations:**
- Use industrial-grade SD cards rated for extreme temperatures
- Ensure adequate ventilation even in cold weather
- Consider UPS for power stability
- Plan for remote access during winter isolation

### Software Installation and Configuration

**Operating System:** We recommend Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) for maximum performance and minimal resource usage.

**Bitcoin Core Installation:**
1. Download Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.org
2. Verify GPG signatures (critical security step)
3. Install and configure bitcoin.conf
4. Start initial block download (IBD)

**Critical Configuration Options:**
```
# Basic settings
server=1
daemon=1
txindex=1

# Network settings
listen=1
maxconnections=125

# RPC settings (for wallet access)
rpcuser=yourusername
rpcpassword=strongpassword
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1

# Tor settings (optional but recommended)
proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
onlynet=onion
```

### Initial Block Download: Syncing the Blockchain

**What Happens:** Your node downloads and verifies every Bitcoin transaction since 2009. This currently takes 1-7 days depending on your internet speed and hardware.

**The Process:**
1. Download blocks from other nodes
2. Verify each transaction's cryptographic signatures
3. Check that all transactions follow Bitcoin rules
4. Build the UTXO set (current state of all Bitcoin)

**Why It Takes Time:** Your node is doing the same verification work that every other node has done. This is what makes Bitcoin trustless - you're not taking anyone's word for it.

**Alaska Challenges:**
- Satellite internet may have data caps
- Remote locations may have slower connections
- Power outages can interrupt the process
- Cold weather can affect hardware performance

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use ethernet instead of WiFi
- Ensure stable power supply
- Monitor temperature and cooling
- Consider downloading blockchain snapshot to speed up process

### Lightning Network Integration

**Why Add Lightning:** Lightning enables instant, low-cost Bitcoin payments while using your node as the foundation for trust.

**LND (Lightning Network Daemon):**
- Most popular Lightning implementation
- Integrates well with Bitcoin Core
- Extensive ecosystem of applications
- Good documentation and community support

**Channel Management:**
- **Opening Channels:** Requires on-chain Bitcoin transaction
- **Channel Capacity:** Determines maximum payment size
- **Liquidity Management:** Balancing inbound and outbound capacity
- **Fee Management:** Setting competitive routing fees

**Alaska Use Cases:**
- Instant payments for tourism businesses
- Micropayments for content and services
- Cross-border remittances without banking delays
- Machine-to-machine payments for IoT devices

### Remote Management and Security

**SSH Access:** Secure Shell allows you to manage your node from anywhere in the world. Essential for Alaska's remote locations.

**Security Best Practices:**
- Change default passwords immediately
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords
- Configure firewall (ufw) to block unnecessary ports
- Enable fail2ban to prevent brute force attacks
- Keep software updated but verify signatures

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
- Set up email alerts for node issues
- Monitor disk space and memory usage
- Track synchronization status
- Watch for network connectivity problems

**Backup Strategies:**
- Regular backups of wallet.dat and channel.backup
- Document configuration settings
- Test recovery procedures
- Store backups in multiple locations

### Privacy and Tor Integration

**Why Use Tor:** Tor hides your IP address and location from other Bitcoin nodes, enhancing your privacy and security.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents correlation of your Bitcoin activity with your location
- Protects against network-level surveillance
- Enables access if Bitcoin is blocked in your area
- Improves overall network privacy

**Setup Process:**
1. Install Tor on your Raspberry Pi
2. Configure Bitcoin Core to use Tor proxy
3. Set up Tor hidden service for remote access
4. Test connectivity and performance

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly slower connection speeds
- More complex configuration
- Additional software to maintain
- Potential reliability issues

### Electrum Server: Serving Your Wallets

**What is Electrum Server:** Software that indexes your Bitcoin node's blockchain data to serve lightweight wallets quickly.

**Popular Options:**
- **Electrs:** Rust-based, fast and efficient
- **ElectrumX:** Python-based, feature-rich
- **Fulcrum:** C++-based, extremely fast

**Benefits:**
- Connect your mobile wallets to your own node
- Instant balance and transaction updates
- Enhanced privacy - no third-party servers
- Works with most popular Bitcoin wallets

### Node Economics and Incentives
