# Today's Session Overview

## Two Main Tracks: Philosophy and Practice

### Philosophy Track: Why Bitcoin Matters
We'll explore the deeper questions that make Bitcoin revolutionary:

**The Nature of Money:** What makes something "money"? Why did societies move from barter to gold to paper to digital? Understanding this history is crucial to understanding why Bitcoin is inevitable.

**Sound Money Principles:** For most of human history, money was scarce and hard to produce. The last 50 years of unlimited money printing is an aberration. Bitcoin returns us to sound money principles.

**Individual Sovereignty:** Bitcoin isn't just about making money - it's about taking back control of your financial life. No banks, no governments, no intermediaries between you and your wealth.

**Austrian Economics:** The economic school that predicted the 2008 crisis and explains why Bitcoin is necessary. We'll explore concepts like time preference, the Cantillon effect, and why savings matter.

### Technical Track: How Bitcoin Works
The practical knowledge you need to use Bitcoin safely and effectively:

**Cold Storage & Security:** How to store Bitcoin safely for decades. We'll demonstrate hardware wallets, multisig setups, and backup strategies designed for Alaska's unique challenges.

**Running Your Own Node:** Why "don't trust, verify" matters and how to achieve true financial sovereignty by running your own Bitcoin node.

**Lightning Network:** How to make instant, low-cost Bitcoin payments and why this technology is revolutionary for commerce.

**Mining in Alaska:** How Alaska's abundant renewable energy makes it one of the best places in the world to mine Bitcoin profitably and sustainably.

### The Alaska Advantage
Throughout both tracks, we'll explore why Alaska is uniquely positioned to benefit from Bitcoin adoption - from our energy abundance to our culture of self-reliance.
