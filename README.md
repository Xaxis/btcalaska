### Daily Learning Outcomes

1. **Self-custody confidence** — Understand every step of creating, securing, and recovering an air-gapped cold-storage wallet, plus how multisig removes single-point-of-failure risks.  
2. **Network sovereignty** — Gain the skills to deploy, harden, and remotely operate your own Bitcoin + Lightning node, providing trust-minimized verification and instant payments.  
3. **Mining literacy** — Achieve a working grasp of ASIC hardware, pool/solo mechanics, difficulty adjustment, and the financial levers that affect small-scale mining profitability.
