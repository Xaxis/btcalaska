1,Bitcoin Alaska,Open Forum & Education Sessions,"Community-Driven Learning: Welcome to a new format for Bitcoin education in Alaska. Instead of rigid presentations, we're creating an interactive space where your curiosity shapes our conversation. Whether you're completely new to Bitcoin or a seasoned hodler, this forum is designed to meet you where you are and take you where you want to go.

What Makes This Different:
• No Stupid Questions: Every question, no matter how basic, helps someone else learn
• Real Hardware: We have actual devices to demonstrate concepts hands-on  
• Alaska Focus: Tailored specifically for our unique environment and opportunities
• Community Building: Building lasting connections in the Alaska Bitcoin community

2,From Structured Sessions to Open Dialogue,Why We Changed Our Approach,"Originally, we planned three separate 90-minute technical workshops. But we realized something important: the best Bitcoin education happens through conversation, not lecture. The most valuable insights come from the questions you ask, the problems you're trying to solve, and the real-world scenarios you face living in Alaska.

What This Means for You:
• Interactive Q&A Format: Raise your hand, ask questions, challenge ideas. This is your session.
• Hands-On Demonstrations: We have hardware here - Coldcards, Raspberry Pis, mining equipment. Want to see how something works? We'll show you.
• No Prerequisites: Whether you've never heard of Bitcoin or you're running your own Lightning node, there's something here for you.
• Community Learning: The person next to you might have the exact answer you need. We're all teachers and students here.

The Philosophy Behind This Change: Bitcoin itself is about removing intermediaries and empowering individuals. Our education should reflect that same philosophy. Instead of us talking at you, we're creating a space where knowledge flows freely in all directions."

3,Today's Session Overview,Two Main Tracks: Philosophy and Practice,"Philosophy Track: Why Bitcoin Matters
• The Nature of Money: What makes something 'money'? Why did societies move from barter to gold to paper to digital? Understanding this history is crucial to understanding why Bitcoin is inevitable.
• Sound Money Principles: For most of human history, money was scarce and hard to produce. The last 50 years of unlimited money printing is an aberration. Bitcoin returns us to sound money principles.
• Individual Sovereignty: Bitcoin isn't just about making money - it's about taking back control of your financial life. No banks, no governments, no intermediaries between you and your wealth.

Technical Track: How Bitcoin Works
• Cold Storage & Security: How to store Bitcoin safely for decades. We'll demonstrate hardware wallets, multisig setups, and backup strategies designed for Alaska's unique challenges.
• Running Your Own Node: Why 'don't trust, verify' matters and how to achieve true financial sovereignty by running your own Bitcoin node.
• Mining in Alaska: How Alaska's abundant renewable energy makes it one of the best places in the world to mine Bitcoin profitably and sustainably.

The Alaska Advantage: Throughout both tracks, we'll explore why Alaska is uniquely positioned to benefit from Bitcoin adoption - from our energy abundance to our culture of self-reliance."

4,What is Money?,Understanding the Foundation of Economic Exchange,"The Evolution of Money Through History:

Barter Systems (Pre-3000 BCE): Direct exchange of goods and services. A farmer trades wheat for a blacksmith's tools. The fundamental problem: the 'double coincidence of wants' - both parties must want what the other offers at the exact same time.

Commodity Money (3000 BCE - 1900s): Societies discovered that certain commodities work better as money. Gold and silver emerged as winners because they're durable, portable, divisible, and universally valued. A gold coin represents actual stored value.

Representative Money (1800s-1971): Paper money backed by gold reserves. The U.S. dollar was redeemable for gold at $35/ounce. This system collapsed when governments printed more money than they had gold to back it.

Fiat Currency (1971-Present): Money by government decree with no backing. The dollar became 'legal tender' simply because the government says so. Value depends entirely on trust in the issuing authority.

Key Insight: Bitcoin is the first technology in human history that perfectly satisfies all six properties of sound money while being completely digital and decentralized."

5,The Fundamental Problems with Fiat Currency,Why Our Current Monetary System is Broken,"Inflation: The Hidden Tax on Your Savings
Since 1971, when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard, the dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power. What cost $1 in 1971 costs $6.50 today. This isn't natural price discovery - it's systematic wealth confiscation.

The Mechanism: Central banks create new money digitally, increasing the money supply. More dollars chasing the same goods = higher prices. Your savings lose value even sitting in the bank.

Central Control: Unelected Officials Control Your Money
The Federal Reserve, a private institution, makes monetary policy affecting 330 million Americans. These officials decide interest rates, money supply, and which banks get bailouts - yet they're not elected by the people.

The Cantillon Effect: Those closest to money creation (banks, government, wealthy) benefit first. By the time new money reaches regular people, prices have already risen. This systematically transfers wealth from the poor to the rich.

'In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation.' - Alan Greenspan, Former Fed Chairman"
